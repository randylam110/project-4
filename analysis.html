                While using SVM, we found that it was hard to use for this particular case study, 
                as it only allows for comparing and studying of two features, as seen in the graph.

                </div>

                Accuracy for SVM is dependent on the sample size given and would not be able to account for all other features.
                An example would be checking dry cough and fatigue. While there were a lot of patients in this scenario that were at low or medium
                risk of lung cancer, it does not take into account for other conditions; such as a patient being a big drinker 
                or the living conditions they were in having a high amount of pollution.

                We used KNN Classification to create the ROC Curve. 
                The image to the left is the plot of the KNN models having two features; the low and the high. 
                The second image is a plot of the ROC Curve, and it was plotted with TPR (y-axis) against the FPR (x-axis). 
                An AUC shown in this plot is running at a constant rate of 1.0 (TPR), which means it is an excellent model.

                <img src="./images/roc_auc.png"/>
                The ROC-AUC score was 97%

                <p>
                As one reviews the various correlations, any pair of features that exceed 0.90 indicate a strong correlation. 
                Additionally, one can review the boxplots of the features and see similar results.
                Genetic risk and chronic lung disase are strong inicators. Whereas snoring and gender are not.

                In both scenarios, we used the relu/relu/softmax activation methods. While both NN generated similar results, 
                scenario 1 achieved the desired accuracy level using only 10 epochs.
