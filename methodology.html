            The objective of our project was to evaluate whether or not certain symptoms were better predictors
            of lunch cancer than others. In order to accomplish this, we employed the following algorithms 
            for supervised learning:
            <br>
            <br>

              K-Nearest Neighbors
              <br>
              Support Vector Machine
              <br>
              Random Forest Classifier
              <br>
              <br>
            
            Subsequently, we created two neural network models to test the data. Finally, 
            while not a part of our objective, we created an unsupervised learning model; namely, agglomerative
            clustering.

          SVM is being used in this instance to find if there are any correlations within specific set of features.
          The data was gathered over the course of an average of 7 years, in a study provided by Journal of Nature Medicine.
          <br>
          <br>

          To prepare the data set for predictions Patient ID and Index were dropped as they are not useful within the data.
          The specific categories chosen were "Wheezing" and "Coughing of Blood", these were chosen due to the number of patients with these symptoms.
          Once prepared the data was then put on a plot and using sklearn trained and scaled for predicting.

          The training & test scores are comparable; 91%/90% respectively. Interestingly, the most dominant feature is "wheezing & coughing."
          <br>
          This was surprising since smoking and coughing of blood seemed much more likely.

        <p>
          To prepare our data for our Neural Network, we used Pandas to drop "index" and
          "Patient Id." In one scenario, we then combined "Low" & "Medium" for the ROC curve. 
          In another scenario we retained the same three values for the ROC-AUC analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the preprocessing was done, we moved on to create or Neural Network using Keras.
          In the following order, our Neural Network consisted of an input layer, an 8 node
          hidden layer with a ReLU activation function, a 16 node hidden layer with a ReLU
          activation function, a dropout layer with a rate of 0.1, another 8 node hidden layer
          with a ReLU activation function, and a 3 node output layer with a softmax activation
          function.
          <br>
          <br>
          When we compiled our model, we chose our optimizer to be adam, loss to be
          categorical crossentropy, and metrics to be accuracy. To fit our model we chose 40
          epochs and a validation split of 0.3.
